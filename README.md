# Applied-Data-Science-with-Python-Specialization
There are 5 courses in this Applied-Data-Science-with-Python-Specialization by University of Michigan. Here I was introduced to data science through the python programming language. This is a skills-based specialization where I was able to apply statistical, machine learning, information visualization, text analysis, and social network analysis techniques through popular python toolkits such as pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, nltk, and networkx to gain insight to a given data.
